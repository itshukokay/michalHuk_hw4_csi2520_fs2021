            My Thoughts:<br>
            Pok√©mon has become the most succesful franchise in the world, yet their main product has come under fire in recent years. While it's true that there are fans who have critised the difficulty, or lack there-of, in recent titles, I feel that the developers are not responding to the larger issue.
            My main complaint with the recent titles from the developers at Game Freak is the lack of polish. Character models feel static and lifeless, the gameplay content is lacking, the story is simple and uninteresting, and a lot of expected features just missing. This isn't nostolgia speaking, I continue to replay older titles and they hold up as great games.
            The recent titles just don't have the spark that older titles have had.</p>
